I am a cybersecurity professional with over 5 years of experience. Below are the projects I have completed to demonstrate skills that I have learned on my own or skills that helped me in my positions as a cybersecurity analyst.

## Objective

My journey into cybersecurity started off by getting a degree from the University of Texas - San Antonio (BBA in Cybersecurity) and becoming a cybersecurity analyst for companies like EY and SAIC. My roles focused more on compliance and my objective is to show that I also have the technical skills to be an asset on any cybersecurity team.
